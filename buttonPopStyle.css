	MEDIA QUERIES IN SIZE ORDER ONLY
		I'm using "mobile first design" principles (even if not always developing the mobile look first).
		
		Common breakpoints according to https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-media-queries-breakpoints-media-types-standard-resolutions-and-more/
		320px—480px: Mobile devices
		481px—768px: iPads, Tablets
		769px—1024px: Small screens, laptops  - 769px still seems tiny to me
		1025px—1200px: Desktops, large screens
		1201px and more— Extra large screens, TV
